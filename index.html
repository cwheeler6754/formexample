                <h2>About Team Ghostbusters</h2>
                <p>Team Ghostbusters was formed in 1990 with seven athletes competing in track & field, swimming, and
                    gymnastics. Since that time, the team has grown to a large family consisting of hundreds of athletes
                    and volunteers. Team Ghostbusters strives to work together to complete fundraising tasks and other
                    needs within the community. New athletes and families are always welcome! Friendships and memories
                    are made to last a lifetime. We have learned from our past, celebrate the present, and look forward
                    to the future! </p>
